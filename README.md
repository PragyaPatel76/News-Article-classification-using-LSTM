# 📰 News Article Classification using LSTM

This project implements a **News Topic Classification** model using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** layers. The model takes in a news article or short description as input and predicts its category among:

- **World**
- **Sports**
- **Business**
- **Sci/Tech**

A **Streamlit web interface** is included to allow easy real-time prediction.
